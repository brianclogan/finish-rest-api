== Description ==

The WordPress REST API is an amazing tool, but it's missing some key features.

It's missing some things though, like Plugin and Theme management, and it also is not standardized with the responses.

That's where we came in, we decided to take what WordPress had, standardize it, and add the things that were missing.



== Installation ==

e.g.

1. Upload `finish-rest-api.zip` through the Add Plugin uploader
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
